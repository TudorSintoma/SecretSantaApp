This is a Secret Santa desktop application using java swing with mvc design pattern and postgreSQL database. How it works:

-There are 2 types of accounts: ORGANIZER and PARTICIPANT, each with their own functionalities inside of the application:

-The ORGANIZER can create, delete and update the data of exchanges inside of the application, as well as handle the participants inside of each exchange that he or she creates (he can add participants to an exchange or remove them from it. When a participant is added to an exchange, an empty wishlist is automatically created for that participant inside of the exchange)

-The PARTICIPANT cannot edit the data of an exchange, however he can view all of the participants of any exchange that he or she is in and view each one of their wishlists for that exchange. He or she can also view his/her own wishlist and add products to it as long as the added price of all the products inside the wishlist doesnâ€™t exceed the budget of the exchange.
